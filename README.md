# VA Calculator

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) administers an income-assistance program called Veterans Pension (or, in the case of 
dependents who survive a deceased veteran, Survivors Pension) about which many misperceptions exist. There are many income-related 
factors that determine the monthly Pension rate to which a veteran or veteranâ€™s surviving dependent may be entitled. Potential 
applicants may use this application to estimate their potential Pension rate.

Disclaimer: The VA Pension Estimator is not affiliated with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and is intended for educational 
purposes only. Any estimate displayed is unofficial and should not be construed as a promise of monetary benefits.

This application is a full MERN application utilizing both Material UI for some styling and Auth0 for user authentication.  The user can 
login, fill out a survey, and get an estimate for what they may be eligible for in terms of VA Pension before going through the somewhat 
long and complicated VA Pension application process.  If logged in, values for income and expenses of the user's most recent survey 
response are saved and associated with that user, so the user may logged back in and have those available.
