            The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) administers an income-assistance program
            called Veterans Pension (or, in the case of dependents who survive a deceased veteran,
            Survivors Pension) about which many misperceptions exist. There are many income-related
            factors that determine the monthly Pension rate to which a veteran or veteran’s surviving
            dependent may be entitled. While there are pages upon pages of documents on the VA’s
            website and on other websites explaining how the Pension rate may be calculated, there isn’t a
            simple, intuitive ballpark estimate calculator that potential applicants can use.
            Potential applicants may use this application to estimate their potential Pension rate. 
            Potential applicants may use this estimate to inform their decision as to whether
            they wish to initiate an often lengthy application process.
